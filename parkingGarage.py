class parkingGarage():
    '''
    This parking garage ticketing system assigns a ticket and parking space base on
    entered license plate info. A dictionary is created within currentTicket for each
    license plate entered, storing ticket number, parking space number, and paid status.

    There are a limited number of spaces (10 total), of which a corresponding ticket is assigned to.
    As customers park in the garage, the corresponding ticket and space are removed from their respective
    lists.

    If a customer pays for their parking, the ticket and space are placed back into their respective lists.
    
    If all spaces are taken, customer is notified that there are no parking spaces left in garage.
